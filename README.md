# PROJECT OVERVIEW
What is DC-AI?

DC-AI is an intelligent, character-based chatbot that lets users interact with iconic DC characters—Batman, Cyborg, and Lex Luthor. Each character responds in a way that reflects their personality from the comics, creating immersive and entertaining conversations that feel authentic and engaging.

Why Did I Choose This Theme?
I chose this theme because Batman, Cyborg, and Lex Luthor are among the most technologically advanced and intelligent characters in the DC Universe. Their strong connection to strategy, science, and advanced technology makes them perfect inspirations for AI chatbots. Using these characters makes the chatbot more engaging, relatable, and fun for users who are fans of DC.

Key Benefits for the User:
DC-AI offers entertainment, character immersion, and interactive learning. Users can enjoy fun conversations, explore how each character thinks, and gain insights into their personalities. The character-based responses make interactions more memorable than a standard chatbot.
